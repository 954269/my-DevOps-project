 Ansible Installation on AWS EC2 


 Install python and python-pip
   ```sh
   yum install python
   yum install python-pip
   ```
 Install ansible using pip check for version
    ```sh
    pip install ansible
   ansible --version
   ```
   

Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)  
   ```sh
   useradd ansadmin
   passwd ansadmin
   ```
 Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor.
   ```sh
   echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
  
   
 Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-keygen
  
 Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
  

Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group. 
   ```sh
   yum install docker
   
   # start docker services 
   service docker start
   service docker start 
   
   # add user to docker group 
   usermod -aG docker ansadmin

  
Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it. 
 
 Validation test

Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
   ```sh 
   ansible all -m ping
